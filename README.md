# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecast-of-COVID-19-daily-cumulative-count-at-State-Level-in-the-United-St

In this project, we make use of multiple ML techniques such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze and predict the rise in the number of COVID 19 cases in the United States based on publicly available daily cumulative numbers of data about COVID 19 cases.

You can also find a python program(Jupyter Notebook - main) that accepts User input for any specific US state  and generates a 30 day forecast for daily cumulative count of COVID 19 cases. This project also contains preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset used.
